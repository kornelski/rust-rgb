/// A pixel which has an alpha component.
///
/// This trait is implemented only for those types in the crate that
/// contain an alpha component, such as [`Rgba`].
///
/// There are no trait methods for dropping of the alpha component,
/// because doing that correctly requires alpha-blending of the
/// color components with some background color. Otherwise,
/// meaningless garbage values of the RGB channels of fully-transparent
/// pixels may be uncovered. For example, removing the alpha channel
/// from Rgba { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 100 } would result in `Rgb {r:
/// 255, g: 0, b: 0}` which is very red when you might want to use a white
/// background color blended with the original color which would end
/// up being much lighter.
pub trait HasAlpha: HetPixel {
    /// Returns a copy of the pixel's alpha component.
    ///
    /// Due to a naming conflict with several now-deprecated inherent
    /// functions with the same name (such as `Rgb::alpha()`) the
    /// `HasAlpha::alpha()` method requires fully qualified syntax for
    /// disambiguation. The deprecated functions are due to be removed in a
    /// future release which will solve this issue.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```

    ///
    /// let mut rgba = Rgba {r: 0_u8, g: 10, b: 100, a: 50};

    /// assert_eq!(HasAlpha::alpha(&rgba), 50);
